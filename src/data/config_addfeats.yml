# This is a configuration file that generates data from open street maps for Boston,
# reads in any concern data, automated traffic records and turning movement counts,
# and then incorporates Boston_Segments or ma_cob_spatially_joined_features to
# add additional features

# City is the only required argument
city: Boston, Massachusetts, USA

# Data directory to look in and output results to
# This is optional, and if not given, defaults to ../data/

# If recreate is True, regenerates ALL processed files from scratch
recreate: False

# Give the city's crash file list
# This must be in a directory named 'raw' in the data directory
# given above as 'datadir'
# This is optional, because the default Boston files are hardcoded
