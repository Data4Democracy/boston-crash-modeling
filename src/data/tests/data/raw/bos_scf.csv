Marlboro street is an eastbound one way street that switches to westbound one way street at the busy Berkeley street intersection.  As a result, there are 3 one way streets coming together.  Many cars take a left on red from eastbound Marlboro onto Berkeley.  The problem is that the are turning left on Red even when cars (that have a green) are turning right.  The problem is worse during rush hour when the two directions of Marlboro compete to turn onto Berkeley and it creates a very dangerous situation for pedestrians that are attempting to cross Berkeley.  Drivers are distracted by the car coming from the opposite direction and are often not looking for pedestrians.  A No Turn On Red sign would help this situation.

I asked that the city put in the iron covers (grates) , like there are on all the other trees on Summer Street, so that people could walk on the sidewalk and not be injured. Unfortunately the city removed the trees rather than put in well covers. My goal wasn't to have the trees removed, we need more trees in downtown Boston. But be that as it may. Now there are two empty trees pits and the color of the material in the pit is very like the color of the sidewalk so now many people are stepping into the tree pit and potentially hurting their ankles or knees. So can the city either put in new trees and use the iron covers to cover the tree wells, like the other trees on Summer St or fill in the tree pits so that people aren't potential hurting themselves. Thank you."

Then, trucks started driving over those holes and make loud booming sounds that shake our home. 

We were awoken constantly last night from all the trucks hitting these holes and I've seen no additional work being done today. 

In addition, these holes in at least 5 locations on the bypass road are completely unmarked. Since cars and trucks are constantly speeding down the bypass they don't see the holes coming up and hit them at very high speeds. At the very least you could earn drivers and mark there holes with spray paint. 

Our home has been shaking all day, and I assume the same applies to our neighbors.

Please bring someone out to mark these holes so people at least slow down.

No, I wasn't texting or distracted, the officer stepped out into traffic without looking. She was wearing a black jacket and in the cloud/dusk was difficult to see. 

If their job requires them to step into traffic or work in the road, perhaps you could equip each with a reflective vest? They're actually required for all roads that were built with federal funds (all in Boston). 

I really hope no officers get hurt, and certainly am glad they didn't today. Why not invest in safety not stealth?

Thanks!"

When the traffic on Milk St has a green light a pedestrian crosswalk sign is illuminated white for pedestrians crossing Washington St at the Old South Meeting House.   This creates a conflict between the pedestrians and the cars on Milk street that are forced to make a right hand only turn.   Given this is and the fact that vehicular traffic is restricted on Washington St heading north is it possible to get this crosswalk sign and traffic lights reconfigured?   Example Washington St traffic heading north could have a blinking yellow when the intersection is theirs and the cross walk sign is illuminated white.   When Milk St traffic heading west has the intersection the crosswalk sign would be illuminated red prohibiting pedestrian cross while traffic on Milk St is forced to talk a right turn.

As I sit here, mopeds are flying up and down the one way roads - often in the wrong direction. This has been a daily occurrence all summer and into the fall. Since posting about this issue in May 2015, I have seen two efforts to solve the problem: 
1. On one afternoon, I saw a cop patrolling the intersection to ticket those who did not stop at the stop sign. Only ONCE in a year and a half have I seen someone enforcing the stop signs. As a stay-at-home mom, we are outside nearly every day, rain or snow or shine, so it is unlikely that  it has been patrolled more often and I just missed it.
2. A sign was hung that reads ""Drive Slow"" and has a picture of a running child. That's a nice gesture. However, the signs have been entirely ineffective considering the excessive speeding that still occurs at this intersection.

I ask you respectfully to please again consider my request for speed humps which will actually slow the traffic and lead to a safer road for my children and my neighbors' children. Please let me know the procedure on how to obtain these. Do I need a signed petition by neighbors? If so, I know this can happen.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
a concerned mother and neighbor"

Pedestrians who need to get from Sullivan Station to the businesses in Hood Park have to wait until the light at Maffa turns red and the traffic backs up then hope that either the traffic going in the other direction is also backed up or there is no traffic. There's a dangerous hump in the crosswalk that poses a tripping hazard for peds trying to cross quickly.  The number of people needing to cross there has increased now that BHCC has some classes at Hood. I don't know the circumstances behind the ghost bike there and whether the bicyclist was trying to cross or traveling along Cambridge St.

1. It seems that when coming from Chelsea, the left lane to turn is timed for only 5 seconds...Shouldn't this be timed for longer? I've noticed accidents because when the bridge goes up, people block the intersection and ride up peoples bumpers and I'm not sure if this is because of a timing issue or safety concern with the location of the intersection.

Also, it seems like this crossing is in need of repaving (or maybe just line painting because I can't tell what is what when driving from Chelsea."

Were more signs going to be put up or was that it? Also, is there any underwritting going into the signs? I have visitors come all the time and were wondering what the hours are for Resident Parking ONLY (like in Orient Heights, its later hours like after 6pm)"

What happens is when the middle lane turns right, but someone in the right lane goes straight and they collide. This happens so often and I have reported it to the city of Boston many times.

Yesterday a friend shoveled out the spot at the end of my driveway, the path to my back door, and one of my front walks again. This morning my Occupational Therapist called to say she could't pull into the driveway because the city had plowed in front of it (during the night?), and  she couldn't get her car over the hump to pull into my driveway, so she left. She's coming back to try again tomorrow at 10 a.m. I also have a physical therapist coming at 2 p.m on Wed (tomorrow). I called the city this morning and explained -- they said they'd send someone to open up the driveway. Now they are saying they left a msg with DPW asking them to fix it, but they have no idea when that will happen. They also told me to call the disabilities commission, which I also did this morning, and they said they'd follow up on it (knowing my time crunch), but I just checked back with them, and they don't know anything more since I spoke with them this morning. I'm also concerned about opening up access to where the oil dealer fills my oil tank. It's in the front of my house underneath my dining room window (to the right of my front door).

Many pedestrians give up and walk across without the walk light because the traffic continues to receive priority and cycles at least 2-3 times before walk lights com on. This was an issue a few years back and was fixed. But every since sensors in the street were placed at the end of Willow Street the problem with the walk lights has returned. "

Below is a picture if signs that are in the  Boston Common. These signs should be posted in all the parking lots just before entering into the parks fenced area. Proper patrolling and ticketing would also be helpful. Please do not wait until a tragedy happens.

I commute the SW Corridor by bike every day and I can't even count the number of near disasters I've seen at this intersection.

Experienced cyclists on this stretch of road already use the full lane and a formal sign notifying motorists would be helpful. Inexperienced cyclists either hug the edge in what becomes a truly dangerous maneuver on the bridge or they illegally and awkwardly squeeze past pedestrians on the sidewalk (which currently has scaffolding on one side during construction work, and heavy pedestrian traffic at times on both sides).

This is not a re-design. It is a sufficiently clear-cut case that it just seems like an oversight to be handled by a replacement of signs that should have been there in the first place.

-71.109877,42.313229,Ask Neighbors for Shovelling Help,2013-02-10T09:18:27-05:00,need help to clear parking lot.,"live on chestnut avenue in JP. My fiancé is a co-owner of a parking lot on chestnut avenue near biltmore street. One of the owners lives out of state and the other two don't offer to help shovel/snow plow at all or to pay someone to do it.  There is limited communication about this lot, despite our many attempts to come up with a plan for how to maintain and improve the lot, which many consider free off street parking.  Two winters ago, we had multiple storms. My fiancé, one or two neighbors and I removed the snow. I was amazed by the lack of interest in helping to remove snow from what is being used as a community parking lot. 

Once this lot was purchased, it was our hope to be able to resurface this lot so that we could get a snow plow in it.  See, there is rock jutting up in the middle if the lot that would damage the snow plow. That option is out.

My fiancé purchased a snow blower with one other owner who never once helped clear the snow from the lot after multiple storms two years ago.

Now I have a horrible cold and my fiancé strained his back yesterday.  We are at a loss about what to do. No one made any effort to shovel the lot yesterday. This apathy makes me sad. With so many social activists in JP, it is shocking what people take for granted-not even picking up a finger to help do anything but clear out their own cars after the ""hard"" work has been done by others. In my opinion, anyone who uses this lot should feel obligated to help us shovel the lot. 

If the lot isn't cleared, I will not be able to do my job on Monday--I need to visit elderly clients in their homes. Hopefully, I will feel better today, but I cannot see doing the whole job by myself. I think my upstairs neighbor will help, as he did Two winters ago. But, what about all the so-called ""community"" members who use this lot. Two years ago before jp patch, I had nowhere to voice this opinion. Thank you for creating this forum. 

Anyway, again my fiancé has a back injury and cannot shovel of use our snow blower. I am sick with a cold, feeling weak, sneezing tons and can do some shoveling, but I am not feeling extremely strong to shovel heavy snow after a very cold night by myself-especially the amount needed.  Is there anyone out there who wants to help?  We would grately  appreciate it. If so, email me at vrhargrove7@gmail.com.  I will also contact neighbors for neighbors but that is mostly meant for elderly and disabled people. 

I eagerly await some replies.

I thought you moved to Washington last year?

I am at work and got your email today about shoveling, it can't come at a better time!  But this year has so far been nothing like last year!

You state that people will need to write in to request shoveling each time.  I am sure you know that may be a problem for many people who do not have computers at home.  I finally bought a laptop, but do not have internet connection so I could never do this every time that I need shoveling. 

You were such a HUGE help to me last winter, I could not have made it through without you and your group!  I am now 60 and I need it more this winter than last, as I had r shoulder surgery 6 months ago and am still doing PT and am in more pain than I was before the operation.  I cannot do any shoveling this year.

What can I (and other people who have no internet access) do when we need shoveling?

Today that barrel was empty sitting in the middle of the grass no where near the walkway. This barrel has been impossible to get with the snow and now with the wet weather the area is a mud hole.

Next to the main path, which leads to the beach from the parking lot,  there is pile of dog waste, trash, bottles, underwear, condoms etc. See Photo. This spot usually has a barrel there during the summer. In case the DCR  isn’t aware and as it says on the DCR web site, the walkway is open year round, dusk to dawn,  A lot of money has been  invested to restore the area so let’s try to take care of it.

Traditional lane markings or dotted lines wouldn't work here given the density and the number of possible traffic patterns, so LED lane markings that change with the traffic lights would make a lot of sense here.

The center lane is the ONLY lane shown to go straight and the center and right lanes are available for turning right.  This is CLEARLY marked by the huge green traffic sign prior to the station.  Too many times I've been thisclose to getting my car hit by cars that make (mostly) unsignalled, (always) unsafe lane changes.  This especially happens most dangerously when there are cars waiting in the left turn only lane.

For bike commuters, this is equivalent to a line of jersey barriers being strung across the pike or 93.  We are forced to either ride the wrong way into the bus lane to a curb cut about 40' in (the upset busdrivers waiting for their green light ""hop and jump"" their busses from idle in what I take to be a threat), or ride down to Tremont Street and risk our lives riding a few blocks on that 4 lane highway with motorists who are upset because we are not on the parallel bike path!

Quick, half-joke but half-serious fix: relocate the stop signs from down Warren Street at Canton.  They are useless, as Canton is one way in opposite directions from Warren.
